# manumorph - Final Project for CMPM202 Winter 2019 
Sarah Frost, David Abramov, and Manu Mathew Thomas 

Part 1 of final project, due Tuesday, Feb 19: 
Solidify the team and the main idea of your project by Tuesday of Week 7. Identify related
projects or codebases. Explain the computational, interpretive, and media making aspects of
your project. What do you expect will be the main creative and technical challenges? How will
you divvy up the responsibilities? Be prepared to informally present your project ideas in
class.
