# manumorph - Final Project for CMPM202 Winter 2019 
Sarah Frost, David Abramov, and Manu Mathew Thomas 

Part 1 of final project, due Tuesday, Feb 19: 
Solidify the team and the main idea of your project by Tuesday of Week 7. 
- Identify related projects or codebases. 
- Explain the computational, interpretive, and media making aspects of your project. 
- What do you expect will be the main creative and technical challenges? 
- How will you divvy up the responsibilities?

# Explain the computational, interpretive, and media making aspects of your project. 

- Interpretive(?) - Create a webapp/tutorial (Ã  la Tensorflow for Poets) to teach neural networks - make it fun/easy to combine photos and paintings
- Computational - port from Torch into Tensorflow 
- Media - manu-mental images 

# What do you expect will be the main creative and technical challenges? 

- Technical: We've never used Torch, complicated loss function
- Creative - we don't have enough images of Manu 

# How will you divvy up the responsibilities?
